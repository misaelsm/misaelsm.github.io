    <p>
       As part of ArcBest's Vaux Smart Autonomy team, I worked on the development and integration of autonomous and remote-operated forklift systems built for modern, flexible warehouse operations. 
        This project pushed me to move beyond a purely academic mindset and embrace the complexity of product-scale systems. 
        I focused on systems-level problem solving-understanding how autonomy, human-in-the-loop control, and existing infrastructure interact in real deployments. 
        Working alongside robotics and software teams, I helped ensure reliable system operation in varied environments, contributing to a platform that balances autonomous performance with safety, adaptability, and operator oversight.

    <ul>
        <li> Supported integration of autonomous and remote operation modes</li>
        <li> Shifted from academic code structure to production-ready, maintainable design</li>
        <li> Collaborated across teams to define system requirements and safety constraints</li>
        <li> Learned to design and debug with scale, reliability, and operator experience in mind</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        This project helped me transition from school-style engineering to product-focused thinking. 
        I learned how to weigh real-world constraints-safety, latency, reliability-while contributing to a system that needed to work reliably in live warehouse environments. 
        The experience reshaped how I think about scalable system design and long-term product viability.

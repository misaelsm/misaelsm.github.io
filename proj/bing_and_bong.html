        During my senior year with the VCAT Robotics VEXU team, I helped design and build an autonomous robot capable of self-localization using odometry and adaptive autonomous routines. 
        The robot could detect when a planned strategy wasn't working and dynamically adjust its actions to recover and continue performing effectively.
        Our team's hard work paid off-we won Excellence Awards at every regional competition and at the World Championship. 
        As the senior member with the most experience, I enjoyed mentoring teammates, empowering them to take ownership while keeping us highly competitive.

        Technically, the robot evolved from an initial frame built with VEX c-channel to a refined structure incorporating 3D printed, CNC milled, and laser-cut parts, all designed in SolidWorks. 
        The software was developed in C++ using VEX's API.
    </p>

        Personally, this project taught me team leadership, complex algorithm design, and how to manage evolving hardware and software requirements in a competitive setting. 
        I'd be happy to dive deeper into any aspect of this project-just ask!

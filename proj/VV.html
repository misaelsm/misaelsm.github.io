        As part of ArcBest's Vaux Vision team, I supported the mechanical design of compute and sensor enclosures used on forklifts and reach trucks for mobile freight dimensioning. 
        My responsibilities included designing custom bracketry and developing thermal solutions to ensure compute reliability in high-activity warehouse environments. 
        I performed thermal analysis to inform enclosure design under constrained airflow and mounting conditions. 
        This work helped enable real-time 3D perception, barcode capture, and cloud-based visibility while maintaining hardware durability and operator safety.

    <ul>
        <li> Designed and prototyped custom bracketry for onboard compute systems</li>
        <li> Performed thermal simulations to guide passive cooling strategies</li>
        <li> Collaborated with cross-functional teams (EE, systems, perception)</li>
        <li> Developed enclosure designs for rugged warehouse conditions</li>
        <li> Integrated hardware into vehicle platforms without disrupting operator workflow</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        This project deepened my understanding of real-world constraints in embedded system design-particularly around managing heat and durability in unpredictable environments. 
        It also reinforced the importance of tight mechanical-electrical collaboration in product development.

      <p class="intro">
            I'm a Robotics World Excellence Champion, 2x published author, and current Mechatronics Engineer at Arcbest Technologies R&D Lab. 
            I grew up with a bucket of loose LEGO bricks and a constant urge to take things apart - sometimes to understand how they worked, sometimes just to see if I could put them back together (not everything survived). 
            That hands-on curiosity turned into a lifelong drive to build, learn, and improve. 
            One of the biggest shifts in how I approach engineering happened during the VEXU Change Up competition, where I learned the value of simplifying mechanical systems while leveling up complexity in code to create smarter autonomous routines. 
            I'm the type who can't walk past a problem without thinking about how to solve it - often by taking a path most people overlook. 
            Whether it's robotics, software, or day-to-day tools, I'm always looking for ways to rethink the system and make it better.
